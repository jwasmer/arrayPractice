## Self-Evaluation on arrays

* I feel confident working with arrays. The index position beginning at zero is a little bit strange at first, but after practice I'm sure it'll seem normal. Everything else makes sense to me, they seem fairly simple to understand (at least at our current level).

* Nothing that I can think of, though I'm sure I'll run into questions as I try and use arrays in a more complex project down the road.

* No questions about arrays right now.
